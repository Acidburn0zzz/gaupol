Subtitle File Format Specifications
===================================

This directory contains notes, samples and specifications of all
supported subtitle file formats.  In the cases where official
specifications are not available, the notes file contains assumptions
and observations that our implementation is based on.  All samples
have geen generated with Gaupol and are therefore victims of any
possible incorrect implementation.

See the file "COPYING" for license information specific to the
