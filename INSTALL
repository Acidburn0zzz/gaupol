Installation
============

  The installation procedure has been written with the Unix-style directory
  structure in mind and might not be elegant for operating systems with a
  different directory structure.

  Gaupol uses the standard Python distutils for installation. To install
  Gaupol, type

    ./setup.py install [--prefix=...]

  By default the prefix is /usr/local.


Uninstallation
==============

  To be able to uninstall, two files are needed: "setup.py" and
  "installed-files.log", which was generated during installation. If you
  accidentally deleted the log file, just install the same version again to
  the same prefix and an appropriate log file will be generated.

  The uninstallation command is not a part of Python distutils, but instead an
  unstable extension. To uninstall, type

    ./setup.py uninstall

  The uninstallation procedure will first display a warning message explaining
  how the uninstallation works. After reading the warning, you can still abort
  with no files removed.
