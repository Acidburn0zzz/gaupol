``{{ project }}`` Documentation
=================={{ project_double_underline }}

This is documentation for `{{ project }} <{{ project_url }}>`_ that
has been automatically generated from documentation strings in the
source code. Please note that this documentation is not human-composed
nor human-reviewed and may contain erros. If in doubt, read the full
source code or contact the authors.

The code in `aeidon` and `gaupol` is split across a large amount of
packages and modules, but all relevant functionality has been imported
to the top-level packages and thus it should be sufficient to import
these as::

    import aeidon
    import gaupol

`aeidon` and `gaupol` were not originally designed to be public
packages; not all API details are well designed or well documented.
Again, if in doubt, read the full source code or contact the authors.
