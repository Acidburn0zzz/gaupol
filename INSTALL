Installation
============

The installation process requires that you have Python and intltool
installed. Depending on your distro's Python packaging you may also
need a package called python-dev or python-devel. For dependencies
required to run Gaupol, see the file "README".

To install, run command

    ./setup.py install [--prefix=...]


Uninstallation
==============

There is no uninstallation feature provided.

To be able to uninstall files manually, you can use the --record=...
option with the install command to get a list of installed files.
Advanced users can try one of the bdist commands to setup.py and via
that create a package that can be installed and uninstalled with one's
distro's package management tools.
