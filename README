General Information
===================

Gaupol is an editor for text-based subtitle files. It supports multiple
subtitle file formats and provides means of creating subtitles, editing
texts and timing subtitles to match video. The user interface is
designed with attention to batch processing of multiple documents and
convenience of translating.

Gaupol contains aeidon, a separately installable general-purpose
Python package for reading, writing and manipulating text-based
subtitle files. See the file "README.aeidon" for details.

Gaupol is free software released under the GNU General Public License
