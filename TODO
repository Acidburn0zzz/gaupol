===========

 [X] Clarify GStreamer dependency as "at least the core,
     gst-plugins-base and gst-plugins-good; and for good container and
     codec support preferrably each of gst-plugins-bad, gst-plugins-ugly
     and gst-libav" (#710138)
 [X] Check that required GStreamer elements can be found and
     print error messages if not (#710138)
