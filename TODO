Gaupol 0.11
===========

 * http://gna.org/bugs/?9895 (Advanced selection features)

 [D] Add a line-break task to the text correction assistant
 [D] Add missing "Auto-detected" encoding entry in the file dialogs
 [D] Save search history to $HOME/.gaupol/search instead of the
     configuration file to avoid quoting problems
 [D] Add support for creating a Windows .exe with py2exe and a
     Windows installer with Inno Setup


Gaupol 1.0
==========

 * Capitalize (text assistant task)
 * Plugin system (see gedit for interfaces)


Unscheduled Possible Plans
==========================

 * (Py)GTK 2.12
    - gtk.AboutDialog: "name" replaced with "program-name"
    - gtk.Builder: Build an interface from an XML UI definition
    - gtk.Tooltip: New API that allows complex tooltips
 * Rewrite some gaupol.gtk.View related code so that columns could be
   added, e.g. by plugins; requires columns to not be identified by
   their indexes, but rather by a TreeViewColumn GObject property (?)
 * Built-in GStreamer preview (as plugin?)
