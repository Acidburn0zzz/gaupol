Gaupol 0.9
==========

 * Rewrite Parser._shift_tags?
 * Test hearing impaired removal with actual files

 [D] Raise Python dependency to 2.5.1 or greater (#9685, this
     should have been done already for 0.8.)
 [D] Add a text correction assistant (Tools / Correct Texts)
 [W] Add a hearing impaired text removal task for the text
     correction assistant
 [D] Add quoting for number signs in the configuration file to avoid
     them being misinterpreted as in-line comments

     try the locale encoding first and if it fails, use UTF-8
