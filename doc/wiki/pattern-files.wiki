<<TableOfContents(2)>>

This page contains a list of third party pattern files for text correction tasks. If you have written a pattern file that may be of interest for others, you can post a description of the patterns here and a link to where the file can be downloaded from.

To install one of the pattern files, place the file under `~/.local/share/gaupol/patterns` on Unix or under `C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Gaupol\patterns` on Windows XP or under `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Gaupol\patterns` on Windows Vista and 7. After that the patterns should be listed in the text correction assistant, given that the script, language and country filters are set accordingly.

Please use the following template to post your patterns. If you want to post the contents of the pattern file instead of giving a link, please add a short entry here with a link to a subpage with the patterns.
