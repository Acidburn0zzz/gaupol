Subtitle File Format Specifications
===================================

  This directory contains notes, samples and specifications of all supported
  subtitle file formats. In the cases where official specifications are not
  available, the notes file contains merely assumptions and observations. All
  samples have geen generated with Gaupol and are therefore victims of any
  possible incorrect implementation.

  See the file COPYING for license information specific to the contents of this
  directory.
