Translating Gaupol
==================

To avoid doing redundant work, first check the latest list of existing
translations at the head of the master branch.

    https://github.com/otsaloma/gaupol/tree/master/po

To try your translation in the source directory, you can compile it
to the "locale" directory (which does not exist by default). In
addition to compiling the mo-file, the desktop-style data files need
to be translated, which is most conveniently done using setup.py's
install_data command.

    mkdir -p locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -cv po/XX.po -o locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/gaupol.mo
    ./setup.py install_data -d /tmp/gaupol
    bin/gaupol

A script has been written to check translation files for some common
potential errors. You can use it to check your translation using the
following command.

    tools/check-translations [XX...]

When done, send your translation by email to <otsaloma@iki.fi>.
