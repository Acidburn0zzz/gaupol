General Information
===================

  Gaupol is a subtitle editor for text-based subtitles. Gaupol supports
  multiple subtitle file formats and provides means of text corrections and
  timing manipulations in a multiple-document translator-friendly GTK user
  interface.

  Gaupol should run on all Unix-like (Linux, BSD, etc.) operating systems.
  Technically there is no obstacle why it couldn't run on Windows or Mac, but
  that has not been tested.

  Gaupol is free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
  see the file "COPYING" for details.

Dependencies
============

  Required:
    * Python >= 2.4
    * PyGTK (with libglade support) >= 2.8

  Optional:
    * Psyco, for best results >= 1.4
    * PyEnchant >= 1.1.3
    * iso-codes
    * MPlayer or VLC is recommended for preview

  Psyco can make Gaupol run a bit faster. PyEnchant is required for
  spell-checking. iso-codes allows the spell-checker to show the language and
  country names in your locale.

  To check the which versions of the dependencies you have installed, in the
  source directory run command

    test/info

  If you have PyEnchant installed, but spell-checking does not work, you can
  run a test to print information on your PyEnchant installation and list the
  dictionaries available for it. To run the test, in the source directory run
  command

    test/pyenchant


Running Gaupol
==============

  Gaupol can be run either (1) directly from the source directory or (2) it
  can be installed to a selected location.

  (1) In the source directory, run command

        ./gaupol

  (2) See the file "INSTALL".
