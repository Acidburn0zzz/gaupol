Translating Gaupol
==================

Gaupol translations are available on the Transifex open translation
web service. It is the best place to check the current status of
translations and if you like, you can use the web UI to edit and
submit a translation.

    http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/gaupol/c/master/

In case Transifex is down, you can always check the status of the
translation files in the development repository.

    http://gitorious.org/gaupol/mainline/trees/master/po

Instead of using Transifex, you can also translate Gaupol the
traditional way by downloading the source code and editing the
PO-files. To try your translation in the source directory, you can
compile it to the "locale" directory (which does not exist by
default).

    mkdir -p locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -cv po/XX.po -o locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/gaupol.mo
    bin/gaupol

If you don't use Transifex, please send your translation by email to
<otsaloma@cc.hut.fi>.
