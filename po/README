Translating Gaupol
==================

To avoid doing redundant work, first check the latest list of existing
translations at the head of the master branch.

    https://github.com/otsaloma/gaupol/tree/master/po

To try your translation in the source directory, you can compile it
to the "locale" directory (which does not exist by default).

    mkdir -p locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -cv po/XX.po -o locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/gaupol.mo
    bin/gaupol

When done, send your translation by email to <otsaloma@iki.fi>.
