General Information
===================

Gaupol is an editor for text-based subtitle files. It supports
multiple subtitle file formats and provides means of correcting texts
and timing subtitles to match video. The user interface is designed
with attention to batch processing of multiple documents and
convenience of translating.

Gaupol contains aeidon, a separately installable general-purpose
Python package for reading, writing and manipulating text-based
subtitle files. See the file "README.aeidon" for details.

Gaupol is free software released under the GNU General Public License
(GPL), see the file "COPYING" for details.
