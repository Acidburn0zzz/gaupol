Gaupol 0.26
===========

 [X] Update file selection dialogs to work better with GTK+ 3.12
 [X] Default toolbar style to icons only (due to gtk-toolbar-style
     being deprecated since GTK+ 3.10)
 [X] Fix errors and lack of updates in multiline text cells and their
     line length calculation and display (#728575)
 [X] Fix initially incorrect row heights after opening a file
 [X] Fix overlapping column header right-click menus
 [X] Fix saving enumeration values to configuration file
 [X] Use Gtk.render_layout instead of deprecated Gtk.paint_layout to
     render line length margin in text views
 [X] Remove header editing dialog
 [X] Remove non-functional speech recognition menu item
     (see http://www.mail-archive.com/gaupol-list@gna.org/msg00069.html)
 [X] Drop support for the MPsub format
 [X] Add GTK+ (3.2 or greater) to list of dependencies in the README

 [X] Update Brazilian Portuguese translation (Rafael Ferreira)
 [X] Update Czech translation (Pavel Fric)
