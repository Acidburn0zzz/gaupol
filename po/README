Translating Gaupol
==================

To avoid doing redundant work, first check the latest list of existing
translations at the head of the master branch.

    https://github.com/otsaloma/gaupol/tree/master/po

To try your translation in the source directory, you can compile it to
the "locale" directory (which does not exist by default). To see a fully
translated user interface, also desktop-style data files need to be
"compiled", which is most conveniently done using setup.py's
"install_data" command.

    mkdir -p locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -cv po/XX.po -o locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/gaupol.mo
    ./setup.py install_data -d /tmp/gaupol
    bin/gaupol

Submitting Your Translation
===========================

A script has been written to check translation files for some common
potential errors. You can use it to check your translation using the
following command.

    tools/check-translations [XX...]

When done, send your translation by email to <otsaloma@iki.fi>.

Upcoming releases are announced on the gaupol-i18n mailing list.
Subscribe to this list if you want to keep updating your translation
prior to new releases. You can also use this list to ask questions
or report problems related to translating.
