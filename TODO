Interesting new stuff in GTK+ 2.8
=================================

- Use typeahead search to replace jump-to-dialog?

	The GtkTreeView::enable-search property has been changed to control
	only typeahead search, not the C-f keybinding to start an interactive
	search. To turn off interactive searching completely, you have to set
	GtkTreeView::search-column to -1.
  

Interesting new stuff in PyGTK 2.8
==================================

http://live.gnome.org/PyGTK/WhatsNew28

- Tighter GObject/Python Integration (cosmetic syntax change)
- Properties as Object Attributes (e.g. widget.props.visible)

Switch to these if something else causes PyGTK 2.8 to be required.
