Installation
============

  Gaupol uses Python distutils for installation. To install gaupol, type
  
    ./setup.py install [--prefix=...]
    
  By default the prefix is /usr/local.


Uninstallation
==============

  To be able to uninstall, two files are needed: "setup.py" and
  "installed-files.log", which was generated during installation. If you
  accidentally deleted the log file, just install the same version again to
  the same prefix and an appropriate log file will be generated.
  
  The uninstallation command is not a part of distutils, but instead an
  unstable extension. To uninstall, type

    ./setup.py uninstall
    
  The uninstallation process will first display a warning explaining how the
  uninstallation works. After reading the warning, you can still abort with
  no files removed.
