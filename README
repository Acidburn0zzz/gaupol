General Information
===================

  Gaupol is a subtitle editor for text-based subtitles. Gaupol is in early
  development stage and does not yet contain any advanced features. The aim is
  to make a simple, but powerful, subtitle editor for multiple subtitle
  formats. Currently Gaupol is useful for converting between different
  formats, translating, spell-checking and manual editing.

  Currently supported formats:

    - MicroDVD
    - MPL2
    - SubRip

  Current features:

    - Support for a wide range of character encodings
    - Conversions between supported formats, including conversion of most tags
    - Multiple document interface
    - Undo/Redo
    - Editing in either time or frame mode
    - Convenient translating
    - Text formatting: toggling of italics and dialog lines, case changing
    - Spell-checking
    - GNOME HIG 2.0 compliant user interface

  Gaupol is free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
  see the file "COPYING" for details.

Requirements
============

  Gaupol should run on all Unix-like (Linux, BSD, etc.) operating systems.
  Technically there is no obstacle why it couldn't run on Windows or Mac, but
  that has not been tested.

  Required:

    - Python >= 2.4
    - PyGTK (with libglade support) >= 2.8

  Optional:

    - Psyco, for best results >= 1.4
    - PyEnchant >= 1.1.3
    - iso-codes (any version)

  Psyco can make Gaupol run a bit faster. PyEnchant is required for
  spell-checking. iso-codes allows the spell-checker to show the language and
  country names in your locale.

  If you have PyEnchant installed, but spell-checking does not work, you can
  run a test to print information on your PyEnchant installation and list the
  dictionaries available for it. To run the test, in the source directory type

    test/pyenchant


Running Gaupol
==============

  Gaupol can be run either (1) directly from the source directory or (2) it
  can be installed to a selected location.

  (1) In the source directory, type

        ./gaupol

  (2) See the file "INSTALL".
