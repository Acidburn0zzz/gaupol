00:00:59:I always wanted to leave my country|and go somewhere else.
00:01:05:I always wanted to come to France.
00:01:07:So, one day when I was 17, I left.
00:01:11:There I was in Paris.
00:01:16:Since I was a bit naive,
00:01:21:everyone seemed beautiful|and fabulous.
00:01:25:I couldn't tell cruelty from kindness.
00:01:30:For me, people were|the way they were.
00:01:34:You just worked with them|or talked with them.
00:01:39:Obviously, it was a big shock.
