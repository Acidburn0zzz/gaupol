Other
=====

  * Keep an eye on GStreamer and its Python bindings, in case it could one day
    be considered suitable for determining video framerate and previewing,
    possibly combined with interactive retiming by mouse-clicking in a video
    player. Currently I consider coding an entire video player for the preview
    function too much work and gstreamer (at least 0.8 and prior) has problems
    with playing some proprietary, but common, video formats.
