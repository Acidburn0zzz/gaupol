Gaupol 0.2.0
============

  New Features:
    * Spell-check
    * Debug dialog

  Improvements:
    * Ability to try multiple character encodings when opening a file
    * Opening multiple files at once with the open dialog
    * Moving to edit an adjacent cell with Alt+Arrow keys
    * Smarter uninstallation

  Dependencies:
    * PyGTK dependency raised to 2.8
    * Introduced PyEnchant 1.1.3 dependency
    * Introduced optional iso-codes dependency

  Translations:
    * Finnish (fi) translation removed

  Lots of code has been redesigned and rewritten. Most importantly the
  undo/redo system, the configuration module and all GUI building and updating
  functions have been rewritten. Separation between base and gtk modules is now
  far more sensible and should better suit possible alternative user
  interfaces.
