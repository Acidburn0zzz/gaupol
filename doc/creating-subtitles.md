Creating Subtitles from Scratch
===============================

Gaupol's built-in video player should provide necessary means to
interpret start and end times and texts of subtitles from viewing the
video and the various tools provided should help with often necessary
automatic post-processing. There are many possible work-flows for
subtitling; here's one.

1. Open Gaupol and create a blank document: <kbd>File</kbd> /
   <kbd>New</kbd>.

1. Load the video file you wish to subtitle: <kbd>Tools</kbd> /
   <kbd>Load Video</kbd>.

1. Play the video from start to finish. Press <kbd>J</kbd>
   (<kbd>Edit</kbd> / <kbd>Insert Subtitle At Video Position</kbd>)
   whenever someone starts speaking a new subtitle length piece. A new
   subtitle will be inserted with a three second duration.

1. Go over the video one subtitle at a time. Press <kbd>O</kbd>
   (<kbd>Video</kbd> / <kbd>Play Selection</kbd>) to play video of the
   selected subtitle. Write down what is said. Press <kbd>O</kbd> to
   play the subtitle again. Now press <kbd>K</kbd> (<kbd>Edit</kbd> /
   <kbd>Set End From Video Position</kbd>) when speaking of that
   particular subtitle ends. Split and merge subtitles (keys
   <kbd>S</kbd> and <kbd>M</kbd>) where needed.

1. When the whole video is subtitled, hit <kbd>H</kbd> (<kbd>Tools</kbd>
   / <kbd>Shift positions</kbd>) to correct for your reaction speed,
   e.g. if your reaction speed earlier has been half a second, shift all
   subtitles -0.5 seconds.

1. Now all subtitles should match exactly what is spoken. You'll notice
   that short subtitles disappear too fast. Go to <kbd>Tools</kbd> /
   <kbd>Adjust Durations</kbd>. Set a minimum duration and gap and
   possibly lengthening to match reading speed to ensure that subtitles
   remain on screen long enough to be read.

1. Done! Save your file! Share your work!
