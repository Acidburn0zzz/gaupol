General Information
===================

  Gaupol is a subtitle editor for text-based subtitle files. Gaupol supports
  multiple subtitle file formats and provides means of text corrections and
  time manipulations. The user interface is designed with attention to
  batch processing of multiple documents and convenient translating.

  Gaupol should run on all Unix-like (GNU/Linux, *BSD, etc.) operating systems.
  Technically it should be able to run on Windows and Mac as well, but that has
  not been tested nor made convenient. Gaupol's user interface is based on the
  GTK toolkit and has been designed to best fit the GNOME desktop environment.

  Gaupol is free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
  see the file "COPYING" for details.

Dependencies
============

  Gaupol requires Python 2.4 or greater and PyGTK 2.8 or greater. PyEnchant
  1.1.3 or greater is required for spell-checking. iso-codes, if available,
  will be used to translate language and country names used by the
  spell-checker. Additionally, spell-checking requires a dictionary, any of
  Aspell/Pspell, Ispell, MySpell, Uspell, Hspell or AppleSpell. Universal
  Encoding Detector is required for character encoding auto-detection. MPlayer
  or VLC is recommended for preview.

  To check the which versions of the dependencies you have installed, in the
  source directory run command

    tools/versions

  If you have PyEnchant installed, but spell-checking does not work, you can
  run a test to print information on your PyEnchant installation and list the
  dictionaries available for it. To run the test, in the source directory run
  command

    tools/pyenchant

==============

  Gaupol can be run either (1) directly from the source directory or (2) it
  can be installed to a selected location.
