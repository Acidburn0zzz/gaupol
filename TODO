Interesting new stuff in GTK+ 2.8
=================================

- Use typeahead search to replace jump-to-dialog?

	The GtkTreeView::enable-search property has been changed to control
	only typeahead search, not the C-f keybinding to start an interactive
	search. To turn off interactive searching completely, you have to set
	GtkTreeView::search-column to -1.
